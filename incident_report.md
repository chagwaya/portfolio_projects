## **üìå 3Ô∏è‚É£ Detailed Incident Response**  

### **üõë Identify**  
- The **DDoS attack** targeted the company's **internal network**, affecting all services.  
- The **cybersecurity team** confirmed a **high volume of ICMP packets** from multiple sources.  
- Affected resources were **logged and prioritized for restoration**.  

### **üõ°Ô∏è Protect**  
- Implemented a **new firewall rule** to **limit ICMP packet rates**.  
- **Deployed IDS/IPS** to detect and filter out suspicious ICMP traffic.  
- Disabled **unnecessary ICMP responses** to reduce attack surface.  

### **üïµÔ∏è Detect**  
- Configured **source IP verification** to detect **spoofed addresses**.  
- Used **network monitoring tools** (e.g., Wireshark, Snort) to analyze attack traffic.  
- Identified unusual **traffic patterns and attack origins**.  

### **üö® Respond**  
- **Isolated compromised systems** to prevent further network impact.  
- **Stopped non-critical services** to free up resources for critical functions.  
- **Reported incident findings** to **upper management & legal authorities** (if required).  
- Conducted a **forensic analysis** of attack logs for intelligence gathering.  

### **üîÑ Recover**  
- **Restored critical services** in a **phased approach** (e.g., DNS, database, application servers).  
- Configured **firewalls to block external ICMP flood attacks**.  
- Developed **a response playbook** for future **DDoS mitigation strategies**.  
- Recommended **continuous network traffic monitoring** to detect similar threats early.

    A[DDoS Attack Initiated] -->|ICMP Flood| B[Network Services Overloaded]
    B -->|Traffic Monitoring| C[Incident Detected]

To block excessive ICMP requests, you can apply a rate-limiting rule using iptables:
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -m limit --limit 1/s --limit-burst 5 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j DROP

üìå Explanation:
Allows only 1 ICMP request per second with a burst limit of 5.
Drops all additional ICMP packets beyond the threshold.
